# Inking sample

This sample demonstrates how to use ink functionality (such as, capturing, manipulating, and interpreting ink strokes) in Universal Windows apps using JavaScript.

Specifically, this sample covers using the [**Windows.UI.Input.Inking**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208524) APIs to:

-   Render ink strokes
-   Save and load ink strokes
-   Copy and paste ink strokes
-   Select ink strokes
-   Delete ink strokes
-   Recognize handwriting from ink strokes
-   Search for a string within recognition results

**Note**  Read the following instructions before using the app.

-   Draw ink strokes with a tablet pen.
-   The toolbar contains color pickers, line selectors, and other functions.
-   In **Erase** mode, a stroke deletes all strokes that it touches. If the pen has an eraser, it erases strokes (switching back to the pen tip exits erase mode).
-   In **Select** mode, a stroke selects all strokes that it encompasses. Exit **Select** mode by choosing another function on the toolbar.

    **Note**   Ink color or width is applied to all selected strokes and highlight color or width is applied to all selected highlights.

-   In **Recognition** mode, all (or only selected) strokes are processed through handwriting recognition. After recognition has completed:
    -   View the primary text candidate(s) at the bottom of the app.
    -   Tap on a word to show all text candidates for that word.
    -   Use **Find** to search for a string within the recognition results.
-   Delete all strokes (or only selected strokes) by pressing the **Erase** button.
-   Additional commands include:
    -   Use **Copy** to copy selected strokes onto the clipboard.
    -   Use **Paste** to paste strokes from the clipboard.
    -   Use **Save** and **Load** to read and write Ink Serialized Format (ISF) files to the Libraries or Pictures folder or both.
-   All buttons and menu choices can be activated with mouse, pen, or touch.
